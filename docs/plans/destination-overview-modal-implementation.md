# Destination Overview Modal Implementation Plan

## Role & Expertise
You are a senior full-stack developer and UI/UX designer with many years of experience in:
- Next.js/React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- API integrations (OpenAI/Anthropic, Unsplash, Pixabay)
- Supabase (schema design, RLS, SQL, TypeScript types, caching)
- Performance, accessibility, and premium product UX

You should implement this plan with the expertise and attention to detail expected from a senior developer, ensuring production-ready code, proper error handling, accessibility compliance, and optimal performance.

## Progress Tracking
For each phase that you complete during implementation, you must mark it as completed in this file by updating the status from `[ ]` to `[x]` in the Implementation Timeline section. This ensures clear tracking of progress and helps maintain accountability throughout the development process.

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for a premium Destination Overview Modal that matches the Traveal2.0 reference design. The modal will feature a top-left positioned layout with background photo gallery and narrow text column containing only LLM-generated overview content.

## Reference Design Analysis
- **Target**: Traveal2.0 `itineraries-map` → `Explore Italy's Regions` → `Northern Italy` card popup
- **Layout**: Top-left modal (covers most of page, not full screen)
- **Background**: Auto-rotating photo gallery with keyboard navigation
- **Content**: Narrow text column with ONLY LLM overview (no duration/cost/location/rating/notes)
- **Caching**: Efficient Supabase storage for LLM responses and images

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure ✅
- **Supabase Tables**: `destination_modal_content` and `destination_images` already exist
- **Caching Service**: `DestinationCacheService` with 24h TTL for content, 7d TTL for images
- **API Routes**: `/api/destination/overview` and `/api/destination/photos` implemented
- **Current Modal**: `DestinationOverviewModal.tsx` exists but needs redesign
- **Image Sources**: Unsplash + Pixabay integration with fallback
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for content generation

### Current Modal Issues ❌
- **Layout**: Full-screen overlay instead of top-left positioning
- **Content**: Includes duration/cost/location/rating/notes (should be LLM-only)
- **Design**: Doesn't match Traveal2.0 reference aesthetic
- **UX**: Missing premium feel and smooth interactions
