# Premium "Double-Click" Modal Implementation Plan

## üéØ Project Overview

**Objective**: Design and implement a premium, high-fidelity modal for the exploration tab that provides deep-dive destination information when users click on search results.

**Expert Implementation Approach**: This plan is designed by a world expert in React/Next.js development, UI/UX design, external API integration, and performance optimization. The implementation will be elegant, efficient, and maintainable without over-engineering or unnecessary complexity.

**Completion Tracking**: Each phase must be marked as ‚úÖ COMPLETED when finished. Progress should be tracked systematically to ensure quality delivery.
